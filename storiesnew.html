 <p align = "center"> <b> Something that is very important to us Charity4All girls is that we get to hear about other peoples personal experience with donating! Getting to hear from others allows us to see how we can make their donating experience 100X better. We asked a couple of people about their experience on donating and you would be surprised to hear their experiences!</b>
<!--story #1-->
<h1 align = "center"> <b> Hear from Raeka!</b>
  <p align = "left"> <b>What do you do with clothes you do not use?</b>
  <p align ="left"> Donate
  <p align = "left"> <b> Why do you donate, recycle, throw away, etc. your clothes?</b>
  <p align = "left"> So it does not go to waste.
  <p align = "left"><b> Who do you think your donations go to?</b>
  <p align = "left"> People in need.

<!--atory #2-->
<h1 align = "center"> <b> Hear from Lauren!</b>
  <p align = "left"> <b>What do you do with clothes you do not use?</b>
  <p align ="left"> Donate
  <p align = "left"> <b> Why do you donate, recycle, throw away, etc. your clothes?</b>
  <p align = "left"> I know that it will go to someone else who needs the clothing.
  <p align = "left"><b> Who do you think your donations go to?</b>
  <p align = "left"> I know it goes to people who need (homeless, low-income families, and anyone who needs it) it because I volunteer at my school's clothing giveaway and we help the homeless get the clothes they need.
<!--atory #3-->
<h1 align = "center"> <b> Hear from Stephanie!</b>
  <p align = "left"> <b>What do you do with clothes you do not use?</b>
  <p align ="left"> Donate
  <p align = "left"> <b> Why do you donate, recycle, throw away, etc. your clothes?</b>
  <p align = "left">Because I don't want to waste what I paid money for... I'd rather have someone else use it than me throw away a perfectly good piece of clothing that is just too small for me or not my style anymore.
  <p align = "left"><b> Who do you think your donations go to?</b>
  <p align = "left"> My family usually gives our clothes directly to the local Goodwill, so I'm assuming it'll go on the racks at the store.
<!--story #4-->
<h1 align = "center"> <b> Hear from Daniela!</b>
  <p align = "left"> <b>What do you do with clothes you do not use?</b>
  <p align ="left"> Because most of the clothes I don't want just don't fit me anymore so I donate them if they're still good to use.
  <p align = "left"> <b> Why do you donate, recycle, throw away, etc. your clothes?</b>
  <p align = "left">So it does not go to waste.
  <p align = "left"><b> Who do you think your donations go to?</b>
  <p align = "left"> Honestly I don't know.
